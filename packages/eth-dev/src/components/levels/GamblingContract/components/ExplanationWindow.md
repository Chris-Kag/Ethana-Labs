Creating provably fair and secure gambling contracts is quite the challenge.
<br />
See if you can find a way to dupe the contract and win 10 times in a row.
<br />
A boilerplate has been prepared for you that you can fetch here:

```bash
# fetch code
$ git clone https://github.com/ssteiger/eth-dev-challenges.git
$ cd eth-dev-challenges
$ git checkout dice-game

# install dependencies
$ yarn

# deploy contracts
$ yarn deploy

# start app
# when asked to use a different port, hit yes
$ yarn start
```
